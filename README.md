**Course Selection**: Designed and developed a “Course Selection” application that allows rising 10th grade students to submit the courses they want to enroll in to the Princeton Day School administration. This was created in an effort to facilitate the course selection process and make it easier for students to decide their courses and for faculty to keep track of student selections.
- Wrote a Javascript program that records a student’s course selection and reports it to the Princeton Day School  administration
